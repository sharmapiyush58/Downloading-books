The pseudocode is here-
Use Selenium library(a very good one for directly accesssing the website through any browser). 

The python code launches a browsers instance and downloads 7 files, waits for all the downloads to complete, changes IP_address,
again launches the browser, repetition until all files are downloaded.

# 100 files so 101
ip-change = 70
for i in range(101):

    if (i%7 == 0):
        browser = webdriver.Chrome()
        browser.get("http://bookzz.org/s/?q=harvard+business+review&t=0")

        #this is the div class that is used by bookzz.org for the download links
        elems = browser.find_elements_by_css_selector('.ddownload.color2.dnthandler')
    
    #multiplying by 3 because there are three links for the same file.
    a = 3*i
	
	try:
        elems[a].click()
	except:
		print('exception caused by index:', i)
	    pass
	
	if (i%7 == 6):
	    browser.implicitly_wait(130) # seconds # safe time to ensure all files have been fully downloaded
	    browser.quit()
	    ip-change = ip-change + 10
	    ipaddress.ip_address('192.168.0.{0}', ip-change)
