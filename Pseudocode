The pseudocode is here-
Use Selenium library(a very good one for directly accesssing the website through any browser). 


from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get("http://bookzz.org/s/?q=harvard+business+review&t=0")

#this is the div class that is used by bookzz.org for the download links
elems = browser.find_elements_by_css_selector('.ddownload.color2.dnthandler')
    for i in range(no. of files):
    #multiplying by 3 because there are three links for he same file.
    a = 3*i
    elems[a].click()
    if i%7 == 0 && i!=0:
        change IP address of the system and (wait for the files to download or launch in another browser)
